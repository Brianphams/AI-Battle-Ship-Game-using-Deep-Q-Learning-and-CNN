ðŸ”« Battleship AI (CNN + DQN)
This project develops an AI agent to play the classic game of Battleship on a 5Ã—5 grid with two randomly placed ships.

ðŸ§© Problem
The AI must efficiently find and sink hidden ships with incomplete information.
The game presents a massive state space (~660 trillion states), making it infeasible to store or search all possibilities explicitly.

ðŸ§  Our Approach
To tackle this, we combine:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to approximate the Q-function, avoiding the need to track every state.

A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) framework to help the AI learn from experience.

A simple hunting strategy to enhance decision-making after a hit is detected.

This hybrid method balances exploration (finding ships) and exploitation (following up hits) for better performance.
